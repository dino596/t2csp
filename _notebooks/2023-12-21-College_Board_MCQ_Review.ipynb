    "I chose D because removing nonessential variables would most likely compromise the accuracy of the simulation, but according to College Board, the accuracy would not differ too much. It would instead decrease the runtime of the simulation since less variables are being considered, but the time required would still likely depend on the complexity of the model.\n",
